# MSE-542-Project

Data Science and Materials Informatics Project

The project is looking at the relation between the chemical properties of compound with its solubility in water using data science methods so that we can predict the solubility for other compounds. 

The data science method we applied:
- Linear Regression 
- Neural Network 
- Neural Network on the reduced dataset via principal component analysis(PCA)
- Grouped Neural Network on clustered dataset. 

Group Members: 
- Zihui(Andy) Liu
- Ruei-Lun(Johnson) Chiang
- Owen Chang-Chien
- Vinsensius 
- Raymond Doerr
